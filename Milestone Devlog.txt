Milestone 1 Version 0.1 and 03/10/2025
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

- Can create a custom animated sprite which has a texture, number of frames, sprite width and height, and a time between frames (speed)
- This sprite allows the first frame to be set, as well as having a function to update the intRect based on which sprite/frame to display

Code Additions
--------------

- Created a texture manager class 
	- This checks whether a texture has been loaded, if not it loads it. Adding it to a map with a name, so it can easily be referenced 
- Created an animation manager class 
	- This has a function which sets up the necessary data for an animation, assigns texture, number of frames, sprite width and height and time between frames (speed)
	- Has a getter function which allows the animation to be accessed in other scripts
- Created a sprite animator class
	- This has a set animation function sets up the animation for the sprite, setting the texture, resets to the first frame, resets the animation clock used for speed and sets the intRect's size and position ready for the first frame
- Created a drop down box for the ImGUI - this allows easy switching through animations for debugging
- Calculating the FPS over a second, and then displaying this through the ImGUI

Tests
-----

- Tested the sprite with a number of textures and animations - correctly displaying and updating
- Tested the limits of the engine via creating 100 sprites with textures and then animating them - no errors arose

Notes
-----

- Need to encapsulate all the graphics logic within its own graphics class

Milestone 2 Version 0.2 and 24/10/2025
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

- Through inheriting from the base entity class, can now create a player entity
	- This player entity through the input manager can move around the screen with WASD keys
- Collision detection through the collision rectangle class, which has been added to the base entity class

Code Additions
--------------

- Renamed the sprite animator class to entity, to better reflect its purpose moving forward
- Encapsulated the graphics logic into its own graphics class
	- This handles window creation and events, sets up the ImGui, rendering, and updating the entities
- Inherited from the entity class to create a player class
- Created an input manager using the observer pattern
	- Listeners for this manager are added in the graphics class
		- The player is a listener and allows movement based on keyboard input (WASD)

- Removed some redundant header inclusions across various files

Tests
-----

- Tested new encapsulated graphics class with 100 sprites (including players) - works as expected
- Added debug rectangle representing the collision hitbox - ensuring the collision rectangle is accurate
- Tested player movement in all directions - works as expected
	- Tested simultaneous key presses (diagonal movement) - works as expected for diagonal movement. However if opposite directions are pressed down and right take priority

Notes
-----

- Improve the movement of the player code
- Add collisions which inhibit movement
- Handle simulations in the simulation system
